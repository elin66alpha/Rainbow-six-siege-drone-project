Rainbow-six siege drone project


Receiver/drone hardware:
I'm using 2 12v/120rpm motors to build a siege drone
Arduino nano (atmega328p) as microcontroler, tb6612fng as motor driver board, HC-12 as the wireless module.
3 lg hg-2 18650 battery as the power supply and also a 3s bms to protect my battery.
Using 7805 to regulate the voltage from 12v to 5v. 
IRFZ44N mosphet to control two solenoid JF-0826.
An 5.8ghz fpv camera. 


send/joystick/controller hardware:
Also Arduino nano as microcontroller, HC-12 as wireless module
two joystick(ps2) module, which provide x and yaxis and buttons
one lg hg-2 18650 battery, a step-up module and a type-c battery protect and charge module.

a phone and fpv 5.8ghz video receiver.
